##Contributing
Before submitting a Pull Request, to increase the chances of the pull request being merged, make sure to follow the following guidelines:
- Use a formal commit message. Commit messages should be in the present tense. For example, "Add xxxxx, closes #123."
- Have one commit per pull request. This makes it easier for the pull request to be reviewed and merged. If there is an issue with a pull request, use git to amend the commit rather than adding a second commit.
- Maintain a formal style of code. Check the code for perfect syntax and correct spacing and indentation.
- Make sure the code works. Pull requests that do not work will hurt your chances of getting code merged in the future.
- Do not use the GitHub editor to edit Java files. Use a proper IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
